The archive RespirGeneratorBioSystems.zip contains matlab files that
simulate the model for Frog Ventilatory rhythmogenesis that we
developed and reported in the paper:

Neural model of frog ventilatory rhythmogenesis.
Biosystems. 2009 Jul;97(1):35-43.
Horcholle-Bossavit G, Quenet B.


Please cite this paper if you publish any research results obtained
with this code or any modified versions of this code.

Copy all the m-files to a single directory

The Matlab scripts

   Fig1.m Fig2.m Fig3.m Fig4.m Fig5.m Fig6.m Fig7.m Fig8.m Fig9.m

can be run to generate figures like those of Horcholle-Bossavit et
Quenet.(2009).
